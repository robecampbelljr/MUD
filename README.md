# MUD
A Multi-User Dungeon

### Framework
This MUD is built using the [evennia](https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git) framework. Evennia is a MUD development tool with much of what you need to create a world out of the box. While there are many "tools" to use to create worlds, you are free to modify the source code to create/edit/delete things as you see fit!

### Purpose
This will initially be a "tutorial world". I will be following the evennia [Beginner Tutorial](https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Howtos/Howtos-Overview.html#beginner-tutorial)
